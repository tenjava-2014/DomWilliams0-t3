Explanation
============================

Every so often, lightning strikes will bring down __toxic spores__ from space.
These spore clouds will __corrupt the world__ as they float around with the wind, and will __infect__ any mob they come into contact with.
The disease has a different effect on each species:
 - Cows will puff up with methane gas until they explode
 - Sheep will rapidly shed all their wool before melting away
 - Chickens will be rocketed into the air and burst into a colourful burst of innards
 - Wolves will become agitated and highly active, launching themselves in every direction
 - Pigs will shed their delicious bacon and shrink into a hell monster before your eyes
 - Players will feel incredibly giddy and light-headed
 
 
Commands
===========================
 There are several commands that will help you keep the disease at bay.
 Use __/eti__ to view the command help
 

 Hints
============================
 - Release the spores into a farmyard
 - Infected corpses can lead to more airborne spore clouds
 - Immunity is highly recommended at all times
 - More spores will be brought to Earth every half day or so
 - Some mobs are more resistant to the disease and will survive longer than others
